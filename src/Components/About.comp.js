            Hi there, my name is Sajawal Hassan and I am the son of Athar
            Kharal. I wanted to learn programming because I wanted to create
            games. I started with Godot and couldn't move onto unity because my
            computer wasn't good enough but on the positive side that was the
            reason I went into web-development.
          </p>

          <p>
            In web-development I learned alot of stuff like HTML5, CSS3,
            javascript, reactjs, express, mongodb, node and much more. It was a
            long journey, a journey that took 2 years as of writing this; but
            this journey isn't done.
          </p>

          <p>
            I still continue on this journey without seeing the end and I love
            it! I hope this journey never ends no matter what happens to me.
          </p>
